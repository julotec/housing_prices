# Linear Regression Project 



## Project Description

This project focuses on implementing linear regression and applying it to predict house prices based on various features. The project has been divided into several stages:

1. **Linear Regression Hypothesis Function:**
    - function that calculates the hypothesis of linear regression in vector form.

2. **Cost Function Calculation:**
    - function that calculates the cost function for linear regression in vector form.

3. **Gradient Descent Step Implementation:**
    -  the gradient descent algorithm, which is used to update the parameters of linear regression.

4. **Finding the Best Parameters:**
    -  the optimal parameters for linear regression for a dataset of house prices, considering features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

5. **Finding Parameters Analytically:**
    - I have used an analytical solution to find the same optimal parameters for linear regression.

## How to Run the Project?
